# UserPromptSubmit hook: deterministic skill routing. Skills often
# go un-invoked because nothing at prompt time reminds the model they exist;
# this matches the prompt against the trigger phrases in skills.manifest.json
# and prints a one-line hint (stdout becomes injected context). Precision over
# recall: at most OMS_ROUTER_MAX suggestions per prompt, each skill suggested
# at most once per turn, silence on no match, and system-ish prompts
# (tool notifications, slash commands) are skipped entirely. Fail-open: this
# hook must never block a prompt.
#
# Disable with OMS_SKILL_ROUTER_OFF=1. Claude Code installs this directly;
# Codex installs it through the repo-local oh-my-setting plugin.
